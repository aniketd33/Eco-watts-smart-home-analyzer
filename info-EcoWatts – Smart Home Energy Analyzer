 Project Title:
 EcoWatts – Smart Home Energy Analyzer

 Objective:

 To develop a smart data-driven dashboard and forecasting system that helps homeowners monitor electricity usage, visualize appliance-level consumption, and predict future energy demand using real-time analytics and machine learning.


 Problem Statement:
 With the rising cost of electricity and increasing energy demand, many households struggle to monitor, understand, and reduce their energy consumption. Most homes lack visibility into which appliances consume the most power or when peak usage occurs. This leads to high energy bills and unsustainable usage patterns.

 There is a need for an intelligent, user-friendly system that not only tracks energy consumption but also visualizes it and provides actionable insights for efficient energy usage.


 Project Goal:
 1.Collect and analyze hourly appliance-level energy data.
 2.Visualize energy consumption patterns (by hour, appliance, room).
 3.Identify high-usage devices and peak hours.
 4.Forecast future energy demand using Linear Regression.
 5.Recommend eco-friendly tips to reduce electricity usage and cost.


 Future Scope:
 1.IoT Integration – Connect appliance usa smart plugs and meters for real-time live tracking.
 2.Dynamic Tariff Optimization – Adjustge based on real-time electricity pricing.
 3.Weather & Occupancy-Based Forecasting – More accurate predictions using temperature and human activity.
 4.Mobile App Deployment – For households to receive daily usage alerts and eco-tips.
 5.Smart Automation – Auto-control of appliances based on usage patterns (e.g., turn off lights if idle).
 6.Monthly Reports – PDF reports for bills, analytics, and carbon footprint savings.
 7.City-wide Dashboard – Can be scaled to monitor smart grid or community-level consumption.


 Conclusion:
 The Eco-Watts Smart Home Analyzer provides a powerful solution for managing household energy usage. By leveraging data visualization and forecasting models, it empowers users to become energy-aware, make informed decisions, and adopt greener energy practices. This system not only reduces electricity bills but also contributes to a more sustainable and eco-friendly future.
